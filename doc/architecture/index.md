### Architecture

This document describes the architecture of the project, divided into several architectural views.

The structure and contents of this document is very much a work in progress, and will be updated as the project progresses.

Slicing the architecture into views is a way to manage complexity and to make it easier to understand and communicate the architecture. In this sense, we're influenced by the the `4+1 Architectural View Model` by Philippe Kruchten - but will also be taking cues from the `C4 Model` by Simon Brown. We don't want to go overboard with the views, but we do want to make sure that the most important aspects of the architecture are covered.

In all views, we will be using the `Mermaid` syntax for diagrams. This is a simple and easy to use syntax that can be rendered in Markdown documents.
