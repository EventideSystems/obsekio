Feature: Onboarding > Orientation
  As a new user,
  I want to acquaint myself with the features of the app
  So that I can effectively make use of its capabilities and features

# Background:
#   Given I have logged on for the first time

# Scenario: User is shown around the app's features
#   Given I am on the home page
#   When I click the "Take a tour" button
#   Then I should see a tour of the app
#   And I should be able to skip the tour

# - [] Look at engagement scenarios
# - [] Look at retention scenarios
# - [] Look at monetization scenarios
# - [] Look at growth scenarios
# - [] Look at user stories, setting up collections, and configuration scenarios


# One idea here is to use an actual checklist to track the progress of the user through the onboarding process, i.e.
# a set of checklist items with links to the relevant parts of the app. This would be a good way to ensure that the
# user is able to effectively navigate the app and make use of its features.
